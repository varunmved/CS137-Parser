###How to use the parser!
Here's a [link to a video guide](https://vid.me/ThkQ)

1. Go to the professor's hw assignment and copy paste the lines you want into a text file called "input.txt" in the same directory as your script (make sure you include the Time, s1, s0, etc. column, and the "---" column

2. Run the script as "python parse.py > output.txt"

3. output.txt should contain the code you can copy+paste
